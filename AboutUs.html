    <p class="text_column">The Oceanic Preservation &amp; Awareness Club is an organization dedicated to promoting awareness about how human actions are affecting the ocean and the ways in which we can help preserve it instead. We are a small and humble club with big aspirations because we believe that anyone can make a difference, no matter how small. Join us in Room B212 every Wednesday for our B-lunch meetings, where we'll have lots of fun games and projects while becoming more educated about the wonders of the ocean. Come be a part of our efforts to help save the ocean!</p>

      <h3>Adopting a Whale</h3>
      <img src="Images/Uluru-Photo.jpg" alt="Uluru the humpback whale" width="350" height="200"/>
      <p>Our major project for the year is adopting a whale from the Pacific Whale Foundation. Meet Uluru, a female humpback whale who was first sighted in 1989 in Australian waters. When you adopt a whale from the foundation, you'll be supporting research, education, and programs working to protect the ocean and all the marine animals that call it home. To find out more about the foundation and its work, you can visit their website <a href="https://www.pacificwhale.org/pacific-whale-foundation/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

      <h3>Sticker Project</h3>
      <img src="Images/EditedStickerPhotos/AllStickers.jpg" alt="Sticker Project" width="350" height="200"/>
      <p>In order to raise some money, we will be selling sticker packs of ocean animals, with each sticker personally designed and handcrafted by us. Some of the funds raised will go to charities and organizations dedicated to helping the ocean, while some of it will go toward adopting Uluru.  A part of the funds will also go toward building a fund to continue our club. Visit our <a href="StickerShop.html">sticker shop</a> to support us and order yours today!</p>

      <p>In order to educate the youth about the ocean in a fun way, our club has decided to write a children's book talking about the five gyres of trash littering our oceans today and their negative impact on oceanic life. Our book will feature Uluru the humpback whale as the heroine, who goes on an adventure to save her calves and the ocean from these gyres.</p>
